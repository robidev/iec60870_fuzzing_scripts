# iec60870_fuzzing_scripts
A collection of basic fuzzing scripts using boofuzz and kitty/katnip for IEC 60870-5-104. These are intended to be expanded as needed.
Currently only fuzzers that connect to a server are here(server/slave fuzzers). Client/master fuzzers will be added soon.

the binaries are simple examples of a IEC 60870 master and slave, that can be used for testing.

Dependencies:
boofuzz, kitty, katnip. All can be installed with pip. 

This is a python3 project.
